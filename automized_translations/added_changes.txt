	1. Changed the csv parsing to taking the "text" column instead of just the last column (stable against dataset.csv modifications)
	2. Did the deepl and microsoft text translator functions, simplified to just take target language and text as input 
	3. For deepl source language "DE" had to be hardcoded bc of some weird behaviour else
	4. Changed the translate_dataset function (inside the list_translator.py) to accept a list of providors and languages (to loop inside and not outside of the function) 
	5. Added an overwrite = FALSE parameter to check if the translation already exists and skip it to save resources (set to TRUE if want to rerun translations) 
	6. Added terminal output logging of translation progress in 25% steps 
    7. Included gpt model too (but manually, watch out while merging) 
    8. Added a test py (test_list_translator.py) to run everything (adjust models according to your available API keys)
